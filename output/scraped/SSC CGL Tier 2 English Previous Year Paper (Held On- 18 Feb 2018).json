Out of all the sentences, sentence R is the starting line as it introduces the subject of the passage i.e. ‘egocentric fixation'.<br>The sentence R ends with the phrase ‘negative state’. Sentence Q describes the negative states. Hence, becoming the second sentence.<br>There is a mention of the word ‘manifest’ in the sentence Q which is further elaborated in the sentence P. Therefore, P is the third sentence.<br>Finally, sentence S provides the solution to egocentric fixation and hence becoming the last sentence of the passage.",

Each country gave eight names and a combined list of 64 names was prepared. This list is currently in use, and all cyclones arising in the north Indian Ocean are named from this list, with one name from each country being used in turn. Almost 38 or 39 names from the list have been used up, but since many cyclones dissipate long before they hit land, their names rarely figure in the papers or other media. The names that people do know about, and remember are, naturally, those that were most destructive ones, or very recent. Aila, in 2009 is remembered with a shudder for the enormous destruction it caused in West Bengal and Bangladesh; Phaillin, also for the damage it caused when it hit the Odisha coast in 2013. Two harmless cyclones, which also might remain in people’s memory, are the more recent ones of 2014 — Hudhud, which threatened the east coast of India and Nilofar, which was expected to, but did not, devastate the western coast. The names in the cyclone list are usually words that are associated with storms; words which mean water or wind or lightning in various national languages. Sometimes they are names of other things — birds or flowers or precious stones.

    "Question": "<span>Read the passage carefully and select the best answer to each question out of the given four alternatives.</span><br>What is Gandhian philosophy? It is the religious and social ideas adopted and developed by Gandhi, first during his period in South Africa from 1893 to 1914, and later of course in India. These ideas have been further developed by later \"Gandhians\", most notably, in India by, Vinoba Bhave and Jayaprakash Narayan. Outside of India some of the work of, for example, Martin Luther King Jr. can also be viewed in this light. Understanding the universe to be an organic whole, the philosophy exists on several planes - the spiritual or religious, moral, political, economic, social, individual and collective. The spiritual or religious element and God are at its core. Human nature is regarded as fundamentally virtuous. All individuals are believed to be capable of high moral development and of reform. The twin cardinal principles of Gandhi's thought are truth and nonviolence. It should be remembered that the English word \"truth\" is an imperfect translation of the Sanskrit, \"satya\", and \"non-violence\", an even more imperfect translation of \"ahimsa\". Derived from \"sat\" - \"that which exists\" - \"satya\" contains a dimension of meaning not usually associated by English speakers with the word \"truth\". There are other variations, too, which we need not go into here. For Gandhi, truth is the relative truth of truthfulness in word and deed, and the absolute truth - the Ultimate Reality. This ultimate truth is God (as God is also Truth) and morality - the moral laws and code- its basis. Ahimsa, far from meaning mere peacefulness or the absence of overt violence, is understood by Gandhi to denote active love - the polar opposite of violence, or \"Himsa\", in every sense. The ultimate station Gandhi assigns non-violence stems from two main points. First, if according to the Divine Reality all life is one, then all violence committed towards another is violence towards oneself, towards the collective, whole self, and thus \"self\"-destructive and counter to the universal law of life, which is love. Second, Gandhi believed that ahimsa is the most powerful force in existence. Had himsa been superior to ahimsa, humankind would long ago have succeeded in destroying itself. The human race certainly could not have progressed as far as it has, even if universal justice remains far off the horizon. From both viewpoints, non-violence or love is regarded as the highest law of humankind.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>What are the twin cardinal principles of Gandhi’s thought?",

Understanding the universe to be an organic whole, the philosophy exists on several planes - the spiritual or religious, moral, political, economic, social, individual and collective. The spiritual or religious element and God are at its core. Human nature is regarded as fundamentally virtuous. All individuals are believed to be capable of high moral development and of reform. The twin cardinal principles of Gandhi's thought are truth and nonviolence. It should be remembered that the English word \"truth\" is an imperfect translation of the Sanskrit, \"satya\", and \"non-violence\", an even more imperfect translation of \"ahimsa\". Derived from \"sat\" - \"that which exists\" - \"satya\" contains a dimension of meaning not usually associated by English speakers with the word \"truth\". There are other variations, too, which we need not go into here. For Gandhi, truth is the relative truth of truthfulness in word and deed, and the absolute truth - the Ultimate Reality. This ultimate truth is God (as God is also Truth) and morality - the moral laws and code- its basis. Ahimsa, far from meaning mere peacefulness or the absence of overt violence, is understood by Gandhi to denote active love - the polar opposite of violence, or \"Himsa\", in every sense. The ultimate station Gandhi assigns non-violence stems from two main points. First, if according to the Divine Reality all life is one, then all violence committed towards another is violence towards oneself, towards the collective, whole self, and thus \"self\"-destructive and counter to the universal law of life, which is love. Second, Gandhi believed that ahimsa is the most powerful force in existence. Had himsa been superior to ahimsa, humankind would long ago have succeeded in destroying itself. The human race certainly could not have progressed as far as it has, even if universal justice remains far off the horizon. From both viewpoints, non-violence or love is regarded as the highest law of humankind.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>According to Gandhiji, truth complies to which of the following?",

    "OP1": "I warned my friend to have been careful and that my dog might be biting him.",

    "OP4": "I warned my friend for being careful and that my dog might be biting him.",
    "Answer": "2",
    "Solution": "The given sentence is in <strong>Direct Speech.</strong><br>The given sentence is in Direct Speech because it quotes actual words. Therefore, it must be changed into Indirect Speech.<br>We notice that the reporting verb is in the Past tense (‘said’). Hence, a change will be made in the tense of the reported speech.<br>Also, the first person of the reported speech is changed according to the subject of reporting speech.<br>When we want to report a warning, we use a verb like 'warned' with a to-clause. The pattern is <strong>verb + indirect object + to-clause</strong>.<br>Therefore, the sentence in Indirect Speech will be<strong> option 2 i.e. I warned my friend to be careful and that my dog might bite him.</strong>",

In Bengaluru, against Australia in 2013, Rohit Sharma reached 20 off the 35th ball, 50 off the 71st, and the hundred in the 38th over of the innings. In Kolkata, against Sri Lanka in 2014, he was nearly caught for 4 off the 17th ball he faced, reached his 20th run off the 35th ball, but accelerated slightly earlier to bring up his century in the 32<sup>nd</sup> over of the innings. On a cold mid-week afternoon in Mohali this season, he was even slower to start, reaching 20 off 37 balls, 50 off 65 balls, and bringing up the hundred only in the 40th over.

One time can be a charm, but to accelerate so crazily three times after having set up the innings and to make it look predictable is a perfect combination of skill, fitness and the right mental approach to ODI batting. You can be all amazed at how he manages to do it, but Rohit's reaction to it is typically relaxed. \"That's my template, no?\" he tends to ask. He remembers the innings clearly: reaching \"50 off 70 balls\", bringing up the hundred \"near the 40th over\", and then knowing that the bowlers can't get him out unless he makes a mistake. \"That is my style of play,\" Rohit said. \"You are set and seeing the ball nice and hard and you have understood what the bowlers are trying to do by then, and it's all about trying to play with the field once you get past 100. It's all about you not making a mistake and getting out. I am not saying it's impossible or difficult, but it's very unlikely the bowlers are going to get you out once you have scored a hundred. \"So it was all about me not making a mistake and batting as long as possible.

In Bengaluru, against Australia in 2013, Rohit Sharma reached 20 off the 35th ball, 50 off the 71st, and the hundred in the 38th over of the innings. In Kolkata, against Sri Lanka in 2014, he was nearly caught for 4 off the 17th ball he faced, reached his 20th run off the 35th ball, but accelerated slightly earlier to bring up his century in the 32<sup>nd</sup> over of the innings. On a cold mid-week afternoon in Mohali this season, he was even slower to start, reaching 20 off 37 balls, 50 off 65 balls, and bringing up the hundred only in the 40th over. All three were ODI doubles. One time can be a charm, but to accelerate so crazily three times after having set up the innings and to make it look predictable is a perfect combination of skill, fitness and the right mental approach to ODI batting. You can be all amazed at how he manages to do it, but Rohit's reaction to it is typically relaxed. \"That's my template, no?\" he tends to ask. He remembers the innings clearly: reaching \"50 off 70 balls\", bringing up the hundred \"near the 40th over\", and then knowing that the bowlers can't get him out unless he makes a mistake. \"That is my style of play,\" Rohit said. \"You are set and seeing the ball nice and hard and you have understood what the bowlers are trying to do by then, and it's all about trying to play with the field once you get past 100. It's all about you not making a mistake and getting out. I am not saying it's impossible or difficult, but it's very unlikely the bowlers are going to get you out once you have scored a hundred. \"So it was all about me not making a mistake and batting as long as possible. That's what I did. There is no secret or formula to it. You just have to bat and not make any mistake. The ground is good, the pitch is nice and hard, so you can trust the bounce and play the shots.\"<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>What is Rohit Sharma’s say on hitting hundred near the 40th over in Mohali test?",
    "OP1": "To not commit the mistake to give chance to the bowler to bowl him out",
    "OP2": "To be very aggressive on field after 25th over",
    "OP3": "To stay calm and face every ball as it comes",
    "OP4": "To stay comes and face every ball as it calm",
    "Answer": "1",
    "Solution": "<strong>The correct answer is option 1 i.e. ‘</strong>To not commit the mistake to give chance to the bowler to bowl him out’.<br>It can be deduced from the following line: <em>‘So it was all about me not making a mistake and batting as long as possible.

    "OP1": "Bowlers become less enthusiastic to bowl out a batsman who has scored a hundred",
    "OP2": "They become so aggressive to bowl the batsman as soon as possible",
    "OP3": "The remaining overs are then bowled by the part time bowlers",
    "OP4": "Bowlers are very less likely to bowl you out then",
