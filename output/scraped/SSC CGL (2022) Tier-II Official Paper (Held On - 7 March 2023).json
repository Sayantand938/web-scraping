    "Solution": "<strong>Concept Used:</strong><br>To determine if a number is divisible by 11, you can use the following rule:<br>Starting from the rightmost digit, add every other digit (i.e. the ones in the odd positions)<br>and subtract the sum of the other digits (i.e. the ones in the even positions).<br>If the result is divisible by 11, then the original number is also divisible by 11.<br><span data-sheets-formula=\"=gpt(R[0]C[-11]:R[0]C[-1])\"data-sheets-userformat=\"{&quot;2&quot;:4224,&quot;10&quot;:2,&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;}\"data-sheets-value=\"{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;The number that is divisible by 11 is 6598321.\\n\\nKey Points:\\n- To determine if a number is divisible by 11, we can use the rule that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11.\\n- For example, let's take the number 5648741. The sum of the digits in the odd positions is 5 + 4 + 7 + 1 = 17. The sum of the digits in the even positions is 6 + 8 + 4 = 18. The difference between these sums is 18 - 17 = 1, which is not a multiple of 11. Therefore, 5648741 is not divisible by 11.\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n- The rule for divisibility by 11 can be extended to larger numbers as well. For example, let's take the number 2378965. The sum of the digits in the odd positions is 2 + 7 + 9 + 5 = 23. The sum of the digits in the even positions is 3 + 8 + 6 = 17. The difference between these sums is 23 - 17 = 6, which is not a multiple of 11.

    "Answer": "4",
    "Solution": "Here the correct answer is <strong>Zenith.</strong><br><span><strong><span><u>Key Points</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>The word <strong>\"peak\"</strong> in the passage refers to<strong> the highest point or apex of something</strong>. In this context, it specifically refers to the peak activity of the Sun in its solar cycle.<ul><li>Example: \"As the Sun inches closer to its <span>peak </span>activity in its solar cycle...\" In this sentence, \"peak\" indicates the highest level of solar activity.</ul><li>The synonym <strong>\"zenith\"</strong> also conveys the meaning of <strong>the highest point or culmination of something.</strong><ul><li><strong>Example: </strong>The athlete's career reached its <strong>zenith </strong>when she won an Olympic gold medal.​</ul><li>Now let's look at the other options:<li><strong>Glance: </strong>This word means to take a quick look or glimpse at something. It does not convey the same meaning as \"peak\" in the passage.<ul><li>Example: \"I <strong>glanced </strong>at the clock to see the time before leaving.\"</ul><li><strong>Point: </strong>While \"point\" can refer to a specific location or a sharp end of something, it does not capture the meaning of the highest or most intense level, as implied by \"peak\" in the passage.<ul><li>Example: \"She <strong>pointed </strong>out the direction to the nearest subway station.\"</ul><li><strong>Bottom: </strong>This word refers to the lowest part or the base of something. It is the opposite of \"peak\" and does not convey the intended meaning.<ul><li>Example: \"The rock sank to the <strong>bottom </strong>of the lake.\"</ul><li>In summary, <strong>\"zenith\"</strong> is the most appropriate synonym for<strong> \"peak\" </strong>in the passage as it accurately captures the concept of the highest point or culmination of something, in this case, the Sun's peak activity in its solar cycle.</ul>",
