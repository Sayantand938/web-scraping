    "Answer": "2",
    "Solution": "The correct option is <strong>2 </strong>i.e. <strong>Constantly</strong><br>The sentence talks about how a mind which is perpetually restless and our ego makes people worry all the time. ‘<strong>Distantly’</strong> means in a distance or far away but since there is no reference to any distance in the sentence, this option is not the right fit. ‘<strong>Instantly</strong>’ means immediately but the sentence indicates a permanent state of restlessness and so, it is not the appropriate fit. ‘<strong>Discrepantly</strong>’ means in a conflicting manner but the sentence does not refer to any inconsistency or conflict so, it is not the correct option. ‘<strong>Constantly’ </strong>means perpetually or continuous, which matches the context of a continuous restless mind, and is thus the best fit for the blank.",

    "Answer": "3",
    "Solution": "The correct option is <strong>3 </strong>i.e. <strong>RSPQ</strong><br>The passage refers to surveys which reveal that malnutrition is common in developed countries. This however, is not Type A malnutrition that is the calorie and/or micronutrient deficiency of developing nations but Type B malnutrition that is multiple micronutrient depletion. The passage warns that the severity can become worse in newer micronutrient groups like fatty acids and flavonoids are included in the surveys. It claimed that commonly ingested levels are low in developed countries for these micronutrients.<br><strong>The correct sequence will be:</strong><br>Many national surveys reveal that malnutrition is common in developed countries. This is not the calorie and/or micronutrient deficiency associated with developing nations (Type A malnutrition); but multiple micronutrient depletion, usually combined with calorific balance or excess (Type B malnutrition). The incidence and severity of Type B malnutrition will be shown to be worse if newer micronutrient groups such as the essential fatty acids, xanthophylls and flavonoids are included in the surveys. Commonly ingested levels of these micronutrients seem to be far too low in many developed countries.",

    "Solution": "The correct option is <strong>3 </strong>i.e. <strong>Despite</strong><br>The sentence mentions that we control our destiny even though apparent evidences show it to be not true. ‘<strong>Despite in’ </strong>is a wrong formation of words with despite as the word comes in singular and hence, it is not the appropriate fit. ‘<strong>Despite of’ </strong>means to be in spite of, but the second of makes it a repetition of preposition which is wrong and so, it is not the appropriate fit. <strong>‘Despite’</strong> means regardless of and it is singular and so, it fits the context of the sentence and is thus the best fit.<br>The correct sentence is:<br>Our destiny is always and only in our own hands – despite all apparent evidence which may indicate otherwise.",

Many is not a suitable option as it refers to countable nouns but efficiency is uncountable.

The decision to ban Russia came after the IOC’s Disciplinary Commission, headed by former president of the Swiss Confederation Samuel Schmid, confirmed “systemic manipulation of the anti-doping rules and system in Russia”.

That the OAR will form one of the largest contingents at the Games, although there will be no place for the Russian flag and anthem, makes the ‘ban’ seem a bit of a farce.
