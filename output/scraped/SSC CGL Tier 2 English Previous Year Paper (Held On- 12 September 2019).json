They were there to launch celebrations on the birth centenary of Vikram Sarabhai, 47 years after his death at the age of 52, by when he had founded 38 institutions that are now leaders in space research, physics, management and performing arts. Former director of the Space Applications Centre Pramod Kale was a 19-year old science graduate from MS University of Baroda, besotted by space technology, when he ﬁrst met Sarabhai. “In May 1960, I went to Ahmedabad to meet Dr. Sarabhai. “I met him and ended up talking for two hours,” Kale says. By June that year, Kale had done exactly as Sarabhai had advised him and taken up a master’s course at Gujarat University. In 1962, when Sarabhai was looking at studying the magnetic equator, Kale went on to be among the ﬁrst few to go to NASA to learn radar tracking. The room resounded with many such memories. Former ISRO chairman K Kasturirangan remembered how they ran into some trouble at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), founded in 1947 by Sarabhai, in their attempts to ﬂy a balloon at 4 am, when in sailed Sarabhai. “He told us had the ﬂight been successful, you would not have learnt even half of what you learnt because of that initial problem,” said Kasturirangan. Many of those who had collected in Ahmedabad in Sarabhai’s memory were teenagers when they ﬁrst met him. Gandhinagar-based entrepreneur K Subramanian was 19 and a student of National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, working on a summer project at PRL, when a man in a kurta-pyjama walked in and began turning all the wastepaper bins upside down, inspecting their contents and putting them back again. “I asked a colleague who that was and was told it is Dr Vikram Sarabhai.

Born to Ambalal and Sarla Devi, Ahmedabad’s leading textile-mill owners, Vikram Sarabhai showed creative promise early. He was 15 when he built a working model of a train engine with the help of two engineers, which is now housed at the Community Science Centre (CSC) in Ahmedabad.

Kartikeya is carefully piecing together all the dog-eared notes he is discovering in the recesses of their three grand homes — Shanti Sadan, The Retreat and Chidambaram.

    "Question": "<strong>Direction:</strong> Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.<br>LAST WEEK, scientists from all corners of India descended on Ahmedabad to remember the architect of India’s space programme, a man whom the late president, APJ Abdul Kalam, had famously termed “Mahatma Gandhi of Indian Science”. They were there to launch celebrations on the birth centenary of Vikram Sarabhai, 47 years after his death at the age of 52, by when he had founded 38 institutions that are now leaders in space research, physics, management and performing arts. Former director of the Space Applications Centre Pramod Kale was a 19-year old science graduate from MS University of Baroda, besotted by space technology, when he ﬁrst met Sarabhai. “In May 1960, I went to Ahmedabad to meet Dr. Sarabhai. “I met him and ended up talking for two hours,” Kale says. By June that year, Kale had done exactly as Sarabhai had advised him and taken up a master’s course at Gujarat University. In 1962, when Sarabhai was looking at studying the magnetic equator, Kale went on to be among the ﬁrst few to go to NASA to learn radar tracking. The room resounded with many such memories. Former ISRO chairman K Kasturirangan remembered how they ran into some trouble at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), founded in 1947 by Sarabhai, in their attempts to ﬂy a balloon at 4 am, when in sailed Sarabhai. “He told us had the ﬂight been successful, you would not have learnt even half of what you learnt because of that initial problem,” said Kasturirangan. Many of those who had collected in Ahmedabad in Sarabhai’s memory were teenagers when they ﬁrst met him. Gandhinagar-based entrepreneur K Subramanian was 19 and a student of National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, working on a summer project at PRL, when a man in a kurta-pyjama walked in and began turning all the wastepaper bins upside down, inspecting their contents and putting them back again. “I asked a colleague who that was and was told it is Dr Vikram Sarabhai. He had come to check how much waste the lab was generating,” laughs Subramanian. Born to Ambalal and Sarla Devi, Ahmedabad’s leading textile-mill owners, Vikram Sarabhai showed creative promise early. He was 15 when he built a working model of a train engine with the help of two engineers, which is now housed at the Community Science Centre (CSC) in Ahmedabad. The CSC was Vikram’s way of providing other children the privileges he had, of experimental research, says his son Kartikeya, 71, adding how his father wished to work with children at the science centre after he retired. “He was essentially a researcher, and believed that people, especially children, should be allowed to think freely and come up with solutions on their own,” recalls Kartikeya, who founded the Centre for Environment Education in 1984. Kartikeya is carefully piecing together all the dog-eared notes he is discovering in the recesses of their three grand homes — Shanti Sadan, The Retreat and Chidambaram. To inspire the young to dream like Sarabhai, Kartikeya is building a permanent exhibition gallery on the Sabarmati Riverfront, expected to open this November.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>‘He was a 19-year old science graduate besotted by space technology, when he ﬁrst met Sarabhai.’ ‘besotted’ here means",

    "Question": "<strong>Director:</strong> Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.<br>Nothing, not even the angry, red eruptions on her face and body, will stop Sneha from aiming for her “dream job”. “I love the Indian Army,” says the 18-year-old, as she sits by herself under one of the canopies at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Stadium of the Maratha Light Infantry Regimental Centre in Belagavi, Karnataka. Outside the enclosure, around 35 women run on the 400-m track. A day earlier, Sneha had cleared her ground tests — a 1.6-km race that had to be completed in eight minutes or less, high jump and long jump — and physical ﬁtness tests, when she was diagnosed with chickenpox. Now on medication for the pox, she is back at the stadium for a medical examination as part of the recruitment process. As she waits for her turn, isolated from the other women, Sneha, says, “I had no fever when I left home in Kerala. Even when I reached Belagavi and got these pimples, I did not think much of it. So I came for my physical and ground tests.” Accompanied by her mother and uncle, Sneha, who is pursuing a computer course in her hometown Iritty, about 41 km from Kannur, made the 611-km journey from home to Belagavi spending eight hours in a bus and three hours on a train. She is among the 850-odd women, many of whom have travelled several hundred kilometers, to turn up at the ﬁrst-ever recruitment rally for women to the Indian Army’s Corps of Military Police. The recruitment of women as Soldier General Duty (Women Military Police) marks the ﬁrst time that women will be taken in not only as oﬃcers, but as soldiers, giving them an opportunity to be involved in active military duties. As personnel of the military police, the women soldiers will be responsible for investigating offences such as molestation, theft, and rape; “assisting in the maintenance of good order and discipline”; and in custody and handling of prisoners of war — essentially combat-support operations. The move is part of a slow opening up of avenues for women in the armed forces. In his Independence Day speech last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said women oﬃcers recruited into the armed forces under the Short Service Commission would be given the option of taking up permanent commission — a “gift” to India’s “brave daughters”. Following a notiﬁcation issued by the Army on April 25, around 15,000 women registered for the recruitment rally at Belagavi, the ﬁrst of ﬁve such to be held across India to ﬁll 100 positions in the Military Police. The Belagavi centre catered to candidates from the southern states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and the Union Territories of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar and Puducherry. Of the 15,000 aspirants, about 3,000 were short-listed on the basis of their Class 10 marks, with the cut-off set at 86 per cent. Of the shortlisted candidates, only about one-third turned up at the Belagavi centre between August 1 and 5 at the date and time assigned to them. Just then, outside the enclosure where Sneha is sitting, a shrill whistle pierces the air and another batch of girls takes off — feet on the wet ground, mostly bare, making a dash for their place in history. “Does everybody understand English?” asks Major Chaudhry and the group of 30 women, sitting on red carpets on the ground, bellows: “Yes”.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>What is the occasion being talked about in the passage?",

So I came for my physical and ground tests.” Accompanied by her mother and uncle, Sneha, who is pursuing a computer course in her hometown Iritty, about 41 km from Kannur, made the 611-km journey from home to Belagavi spending eight hours in a bus and three hours on a train. She is among the 850-odd women, many of whom have travelled several hundred kilometers, to turn up at the ﬁrst-ever recruitment rally for women to the Indian Army’s Corps of Military Police. The recruitment of women as Soldier General Duty (Women Military Police) marks the ﬁrst time that women will be taken in not only as oﬃcers, but as soldiers, giving them an opportunity to be involved in active military duties. As personnel of the military police, the women soldiers will be responsible for investigating offences such as molestation, theft, and rape; “assisting in the maintenance of good order and discipline”; and in custody and handling of prisoners of war — essentially combat-support operations. The move is part of a slow opening up of avenues for women in the armed forces. In his Independence Day speech last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said women oﬃcers recruited into the armed forces under the Short Service Commission would be given the option of taking up permanent commission — a “gift” to India’s “brave daughters”. Following a notiﬁcation issued by the Army on April 25, around 15,000 women registered for the recruitment rally at Belagavi, the ﬁrst of ﬁve such to be held across India to ﬁll 100 positions in the Military Police. The Belagavi centre catered to candidates from the southern states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and the Union Territories of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar and Puducherry. Of the 15,000 aspirants, about 3,000 were short-listed on the basis of their Class 10 marks, with the cut-off set at 86 per cent. Of the shortlisted candidates, only about one-third turned up at the Belagavi centre between August 1 and 5 at the date and time assigned to them. Just then, outside the enclosure where Sneha is sitting, a shrill whistle pierces the air and another batch of girls takes off — feet on the wet ground, mostly bare, making a dash for their place in history. “Does everybody understand English?” asks Major Chaudhry and the group of 30 women, sitting on red carpets on the ground, bellows: “Yes”.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>Which city does Sneha come from?",

As personnel of the military police, the women soldiers will be responsible for investigating offences such as molestation, theft, and rape; “assisting in the maintenance of good order and discipline”; and in custody and handling of prisoners of war — essentially combat-support operations. The move is part of a slow opening up of avenues for women in the armed forces. In his Independence Day speech last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said women oﬃcers recruited into the armed forces under the Short Service Commission would be given the option of taking up permanent commission — a “gift” to India’s “brave daughters”. Following a notiﬁcation issued by the Army on April 25, around 15,000 women registered for the recruitment rally at Belagavi, the ﬁrst of ﬁve such to be held across India to ﬁll 100 positions in the Military Police. The Belagavi centre catered to candidates from the southern states of Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and the Union Territories of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar and Puducherry. Of the 15,000 aspirants, about 3,000 were short-listed on the basis of their Class 10 marks, with the cut-off set at 86 per cent. Of the shortlisted candidates, only about one-third turned up at the Belagavi centre between August 1 and 5 at the date and time assigned to them. Just then, outside the enclosure where Sneha is sitting, a shrill whistle pierces the air and another batch of girls takes off — feet on the wet ground, mostly bare, making a dash for their place in history. “Does everybody understand English?” asks Major Chaudhry and the group of 30 women, sitting on red carpets on the ground, bellows: “Yes”.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>Which of the following states were not covered by the Belagavi centre?",
    "OP1": "Karnataka and Kerala",
    "OP2": "Maharashtra and Goa",

    "Question": "<strong>Director:</strong> Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.<br>Nothing, not even the angry, red eruptions on her face and body, will stop Sneha from aiming for her “dream job”. “I love the Indian Army,” says the 18-year-old, as she sits by herself under one of the canopies at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Stadium of the Maratha Light Infantry Regimental Centre in Belagavi, Karnataka. Outside the enclosure, around 35 women run on the 400-m track. A day earlier, Sneha had cleared her ground tests — a 1.6-km race that had to be completed in eight minutes or less, high jump and long jump — and physical ﬁtness tests, when she was diagnosed with chickenpox. Now on medication for the pox, she is back at the stadium for a medical examination as part of the recruitment process. As she waits for her turn, isolated from the other women, Sneha, says, “I had no fever when I left home in Kerala. Even when I reached Belagavi and got these pimples, I did not think much of it. So I came for my physical and ground tests.” Accompanied by her mother and uncle, Sneha, who is pursuing a computer course in her hometown Iritty, about 41 km from Kannur, made the 611-km journey from home to Belagavi spending eight hours in a bus and three hours on a train. She is among the 850-odd women, many of whom have travelled several hundred kilometers, to turn up at the ﬁrst-ever recruitment rally for women to the Indian Army’s Corps of Military Police.

    "Solution": "<ul><li><strong>The correct answer is Option 4.</strong><li>From the given sentences, sentence C says that a police chased the dog. The use of the definite article '<strong>the</strong>' before dog shows that the dog has been already introduced in other sentences so the first sentence doesn't begin with sentence C.<li>From sentence B it is understood that 'Chihuahua' is a dog.<li>Therefore, the correct answer begins with sentence D as it is introducing the dog that ran across a bridge.<li>Sentences C and B make paired sentences as they mean after chasing the dog the police finally caught the dog.<li><strong>Therefore, the correct sequence is given in Option 4 i.e. 'DCBA'.</strong></ul>",

    "Solution": "The correct answer is '<strong>No improvement'.</strong><br><span><strong><span><u>Key Points</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>The original sentence is: \"For most people a six ﬁgure salary was unimaginable two decades ago.\" This sentence is already well-written and effectively conveys its meaning.<br><ul><li>It explains that two decades ago, a six-figure salary was unimaginable for most people.<br><li>There is no grammatical error, and the sentence is clear and concise.<br></ul></ul><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li><strong>Option 2,</strong> \"For most of people\", is not grammatically correct. The correct wording would be \"For most people\". However, even with the correct grammar, this option does not improve the sentence. It simply rephrases the original sentence without adding any new information or improving its clarity.<br><li><strong>Option 3,</strong> \"For a many people\", is also not grammatically correct. The correct wording would be \"For many people\". However, even with the correct grammar, this option changes the meaning of the original sentence slightly. It implies that a six-figure salary was unimaginable for many people, but not necessarily for the majority of people. The original sentence, on the other hand, implies that a six-figure salary was unimaginable for the majority of people.<br><li><strong>Option 4,</strong> \"To much people\", is not grammatically correct. The correct wording would be \"Too many people\". However, even with the correct grammar, this option changes the meaning of the original sentence completely. \"Too many people\" means \"an excessive number of people\", which is not what the original sentence is trying to convey.<br><li>Therefore, the best option is \"<strong>No improvement</strong>\". The original sentence is well-written, clear, and concise. It effectively conveys its intended meaning, and there is no need to change it.<br></ul>",
