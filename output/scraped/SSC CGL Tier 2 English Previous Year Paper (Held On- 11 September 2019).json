    "Answer": "4",
    "Solution": "<strong>The correct answer is option 4.</strong><br>The sentence is clearly an <strong>exclamation</strong>. So, we will use <strong>exclaimed</strong>. The indirect form will use <strong>'she' </strong>instead of<strong> 'I' </strong>and use the<strong> past participle</strong> form of the verbs. In the second part, <strong>wished</strong> should be used as the <strong>act of wishing</strong> is taking place in the<strong> present</strong>.<br>When we convert a sentence from direct to indirect speech, we make the following changes:<br><ul><li><strong>Quotation marks</strong> are <strong>omitted</strong> and the sentence<strong> ends with a full stop</strong>.<li>The <strong>tense</strong> of the <strong>verb</strong>, in the reported speech involving any <strong>order, request and instruction</strong> does<strong> not undergo</strong> any <strong>change </strong>during the conversion from direct to indirect mode. This is also true if the statement is a<strong> universal truth.</strong><li>If the<strong> reporting verb</strong> is in the <strong>present tense</strong>, it does <strong>not undergo</strong> any <strong>change</strong>.<li>We add the word<strong> 'to' </strong>before the verb if the verb is in <strong>bare infinitive</strong>.<li>When the reporting or <strong>principal verb</strong> is in the <strong>present tense</strong>, all present tenses of the direct are <strong>changed</strong> into the corresponding<strong> past tenses.</strong><li>Words expressing <strong>nearness in time or place</strong> are generally converted into into words expressing<strong> distance</strong>. For eg.<strong> now</strong> becomes <strong>then</strong>,<strong> today</strong> becomes <strong>that day</strong>, <strong>yesterday</strong> becomes <strong>the previous day</strong>, <strong>this</strong> becomes<strong> that</strong> etc.<li>In reporting <strong>commands and requests</strong>, the<strong> verb expressing command or request</strong> is <strong>added</strong> and the<strong> imperative </strong>is changed into the<strong> infinitive.</strong><li>In reporting<strong> questions</strong> the<strong> verbs like asked, inquired</strong> are <strong>added</strong><li>In reporting<strong> exclamations and wishes</strong>, the<strong> verbs expressing exclamation or wish</strong> are <strong>added</strong>.<li>When we convert a sentence from the direct to the indirect mode(especially for a sentence<strong> ending</strong> with a<strong> mark of interrogation</strong>), we<strong> reverse</strong> the <strong>subject-verb placement.</strong> In <strong>direct</strong> sentences, we have the <strong>verb before the subject</strong>; while in<strong> indirect,</strong> the <strong>verb follows the subject.</strong></ul>So, <strong>option 4</strong> is correct.",

They decide by themselves that they’re “undeserving” of music, sport, art and drama. Unbelievably, in 2019, children as young as 10 are already hard-wired with the self-limiting poverty notion of “not for the likes of us”.<br>This is heartbreaking. It’s hardly news that life is tougher for poorer children, but it’s an outrage if all sense of curiosity, artistry, and playfulness is knocked out of them so early. Something is wrong if better-off children feel entitled to explore and participate in areas that interest and excite them, while the disadvantaged are cast from the start as cultural wallflowers – doomed to sit out every dance.<br>This isn’t about every child learning the piano or violin (but why not?), it’s about sowing the seeds for a cultural hinterland that will sustain and enrich them for life. It’s about people exploring their passions and refusing to have their horizons artificially limited. Regardless of circumstances, all children should know that their faces “fit” – automatically and forever. Culture belongs to everyone.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>According to the author, what is truly heart - breaking and damaging for the kids is that -",
