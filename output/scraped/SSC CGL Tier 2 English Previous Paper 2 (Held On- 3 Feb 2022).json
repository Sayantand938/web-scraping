The use of steam engines to drive machines slowly transformed industry.<br>Meanwhile, during the 1700s Britain built up a great overseas empire. The North American colonies were lost after the War of Independence 1776-1783. On the other hand, after the Seven Years War 1756-1763, Britain captured Canada and India.

They can be the gateway to work, be it in the arts or the sciences, that define the history of the world. Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, John Milton and Lord Byron used such time to add to their formidable body of work in science and literature.

It was during this time that he conducted his famous prism experiment. “He bored a hole through his window shutters to produce a single, thin beam of light to pass through two prisms, proving for the first time that prisms did not create colours, but merely separated colours that were already there,” the university’s researcher, Alisha Matthewson-Grand, wrote.<br>“Indeed, Newton was so intellectually transformed by his period of isolation that later commentators have referred to his time away from Cambridge as his annus mirabilis, or his ‘year of wonders’.”<br>Charles Darwin (Christ’s College): Darwin’s experience with isolation was not the result of a pandemic but his own chronic ill health. He suffered from a myriad of unexplained symptoms, including vertigo, vomiting, cramps, fatigue, anxiety and visual disturbances. He noted in his autobiography of 1876 that “few persons can have lived a more retired life than we [Darwin and his wife Emma] have done.

He was furious at the prospect of spending 40 days in lockdown, a measure he considered to be draconian and unnecessary. While confined, he wrote ‘Farewell to Malta’, a satirical poem attacking the island for (among other things) “Its smoky towns and cloudy sky” and its “cursed street of stairs”. He references his quarantine explicitly in the first verse “Adieu, thou damned’st quarantine / That gave me fever, and the spleen!’.<br>John Milton (Christ’s College): The author of ‘Paradise Lost’ spent some time away from Cambridge as a first year undergraduate in 1626, when the town was hit by bubonic plague.

It was during this time that he conducted his famous prism experiment. “He bored a hole through his window shutters to produce a single, thin beam of light to pass through two prisms, proving for the first time that prisms did not create colours, but merely separated colours that were already there,” the university’s researcher, Alisha Matthewson-Grand, wrote.<br>“Indeed, Newton was so intellectually transformed by his period of isolation that later commentators have referred to his time away from Cambridge as his annus mirabilis, or his ‘year of wonders’.”<br>Charles Darwin (Christ’s College): Darwin’s experience with isolation was not the result of a pandemic but his own chronic ill health. He suffered from a myriad of unexplained symptoms, including vertigo, vomiting, cramps, fatigue, anxiety and visual disturbances. He noted in his autobiography of 1876 that “few persons can have lived a more retired life than we [Darwin and his wife Emma] have done. Besides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to the seaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere.”<br>Darwin believed that periods of isolation and ill health helped his career. At home, he was free from the demands placed on other scientists (teaching, administrative work), and thus able to devote himself entirely to research; he wrote: “Ill-health, though it has annihilated several years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society and amusement.”<br>Lord Byron (Trinity College): In 1811, Lord Byron was forced to quarantine in Malta after returning from a cholera-ravaged Greece. He was furious at the prospect of spending 40 days in lockdown, a measure he considered to be draconian and unnecessary. While confined, he wrote ‘Farewell to Malta’, a satirical poem attacking the island for (among other things) “Its smoky towns and cloudy sky” and its “cursed street of stairs”. He references his quarantine explicitly in the first verse “Adieu, thou damned’st quarantine / That gave me fever, and the spleen!’.<br>John Milton (Christ’s College): The author of ‘Paradise Lost’ spent some time away from Cambridge as a first year undergraduate in 1626, when the town was hit by bubonic plague. He was home in London when he wrote Elegia Prima, his first Latin elegy.
