Based on this, we can evaluate the two courses of action:<br>Course of action I: The villagers should be provided with an alternate source of income in their villages which will make them stay there only. This course of action seems logical and appropriate as providing an alternate source of income in their villages would help them stay in their villages instead of migrating to urban areas. This can also help in reducing the pressure on urban areas and improving the overall living conditions of the villagers in their own villages.<br>Course of action II: To ensure their survival, the migrated villagers should be given access to all housing options in urban areas. This course of action is not a practical solution as providing access to all housing options in urban areas may not be possible for the authorities. It may also not solve the root cause of the problem, which is the repeated crop failure leading to financial problems. Moreover, providing housing options to migrants may lead to the creation of slums and other social problems in urban areas.<br>Therefore, only course of action I logically follows for pursuing.<br>Hence, the correct answer is <strong>\"Option 4\".</strong>",

    "Question": "In this question, two statements I and II have been given. These statements may be independent causes or effects of independent causes or a common cause. One of the statements may be the effect of the other statement. Read both statements and select the correct answer.<br>I. Country X reduced their crude oil import by 6% in the last 5 years.<br>II. The automobile industry in Country X has witnessed a sharp decline of 13% in its growth margin this year.",
    "OP1": "Both I and II are effects of independent causes.",
    "OP2": "I is the cause and II is its possible effect.",
    "OP3": "II is the cause and I is its possible effect.",
    "OP4": "Both I and II are independent causes.",
    "Answer": "1",
    "Solution": "I. Country X reduced their crude oil import by 6% in the last 5 years.:<br>The reduction in crude oil import may have been due to various reasons such as increased domestic production, shift towards renewable energy sources, or decreased demand for oil.<br>Similarly,<br>II. The automobile industry in Country X has witnessed a sharp decline of 13% in its growth margin this year.:<br>The decline in the growth margin of the automobile industry may have been due to factors such as economic slowdown, increased competition, or changes in consumer preferences. There is no clear cause-effect relationship between the two statements.<br>Therefore, Option 1 is correct because both statements are independent effects of different causes.<br>Hence, the correct answer is \"Option 1\".",

Bhattacharyya claimed that the discovery is extremely significant. “Starting from the Lower Palaeolithic to Middle Palaeolithic then Upper Palaeolithic, we see the evolution here.

Secondary memory is often used as a backup for data that is stored in primary memory (RAM).<li>This is because the data stored in RAM is volatile and can be lost if the power is turned off or if there is a system crash.<li>By contrast, data stored in secondary memory is non-volatile and can be retrieved even if the computer shuts down unexpectedly.<li>Data is permanently stored even if power is switched OFF: This statement is correct.<li>As mentioned earlier, secondary memory is non-volatile, which means that it retains data even when the power is switched off.<li>This is in contrast to primary memory (RAM), which is volatile and loses its contents when the power is turned off.<li>Computer may run without the secondary memory: This statement is also correct.<li>While secondary memory is an important component of a computer system, a computer can still run without it.<li>However, the absence of secondary memory will limit the amount of data and programs that the computer can store and access.<li>The computer will have to rely solely on its primary memory (RAM), which is usually much smaller in capacity than secondary memory.</ul>",

Hence statement 2 is not correct.<li>The gateway is also known as the network connector and the protocol converter.</ul><span><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span></span><br><ul><li><span>Node:</span><ul><li>A node could also be a point of intersection/connection within a data communication network.<li>In an environment where all devices are accessible through the network, these devices are all considered nodes.</ul><li><span>Bridge:</span><ul><li>Bridges are used to connect two subnetworks that use interchangeable protocols.<li>It combines two LANs to form an extended LAN.<li>The foremost difference between the bridge and the repeater is that the bridge has a penetrating efficiency.</ul><li><span>Router:</span><ul><li>A router receives and sends data on computer networks.<li>Routers are sometimes confused with network hubs, modems, or network switches.<li>However, routers can combine the functions of these components, and connect with these devices, to reinforce Internet access or help create business networks.</ul></ul>",

    "OP2": "<span>Network Surface Unit</span>",
    "OP3": "<span>Protocol</span>",
    "OP4": "<span>Domain Name</span>",
    "Answer": "3",
    "Solution": "<ul><li>Protocol are rules that exist at several levels in a telecommunication connection.<li>Protocols are a set of rules and standards that govern how data is transmitted between devices in a network.<li>They define the format, timing, sequencing, and error checking of data transmitted over a network, and enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other. Examples of common protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS.</ul><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>Bandwidth: Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a communication channel in a given amount of time.<li>It is typically measured in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second (Bps).<li>Bandwidth is an important factor in determining the speed and capacity of a network, and it is affected by factors such as the type of transmission medium, the number of users on the network, and the quality of the signal.<li>Network Surface Unit: It's possible that you meant \"Network Interface Unit\" or \"Network Interface Card\" (NIC), which is a hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network.<li>A NIC typically provides a physical interface (such as an Ethernet port) for connecting to the network, as well as the necessary drivers and software for controlling the connection.<li>Domain Name: A domain name is a unique identifier for a website or other internet resource.<li>It typically consists of two parts: a top-level domain (TLD), such as .com, .org, or .edu, and a second-level domain (SLD), which is the specific name chosen by the owner of the domain.<li>Domain names are used to make it easier for users to find and access websites, and they are managed by domain name registrars and domain name system (DNS) servers.</ul>",

    "Answer": "4",
    "Solution": "<strong>The font effect that is not available in the MS-Word 2010 font dialog box is \"Equalize Character Height\".</strong><br><ul><li>Equalize Character Height: This option is not available in the MS-Word 2010 font dialog box, but in general, it would be used to adjust the size of characters so that they are all the same height.<li>This can be useful for creating a consistent look across text that uses different fonts or styles.<li>However, as noted, this option is not available in MS-Word 2010, so it cannot be used in that program.</ul><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>Superscript: This option is used to format text so that it appears above the regular text line and slightly smaller.<li>It is commonly used for mathematical and scientific formulas, as well as for footnotes.<li>Small Caps: This option formats the selected text in a way that makes all the letters uppercase, but with the lowercase letters being smaller than the uppercase letters.<li>This option is useful for creating headings and titles that stand out without being too obtrusive.<li>Double Strikethrough: This option adds a double line through the selected text, creating a strikethrough effect that is thicker than the single strikethrough option.<li>It is often used to indicate that text has been completely deleted or to emphasize that something is not applicable.</ul>",
