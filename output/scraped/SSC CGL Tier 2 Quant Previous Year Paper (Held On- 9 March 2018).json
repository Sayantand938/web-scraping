    "Solution": "<strong>Given:</strong><br>Simple Interest for 3 years = Rs.900<br>Interest Compounded annually in 2 years = Rs.636<br><strong>Formula Used:</strong><br>Simple Interest (SI) = (P × R × T)/100 ----(i)<br>and<br>When Compound Interest (CI) compounded annually,<br>Amount = P × [1 + (R/100)]<sup>T</sup> ----(ii)<br>CI = Amount – Principal ----(iii)<br>Where, P = Principal, R = Rate of Interest, T = Time period.<br><strong>Calculation:</strong><br>We get the relation for SI as:<br>900 = (P × R × 3)/100<br>⇒ P = 30000/R ----(iv)<br>Similarly, CI can be obtained, from equations (ii), (iii) and (iv) as:<br>636 = (30000/R) × {[1 + (R/100)]<sup>2</sup> – 1}<br>⇒ R = 12%<br><strong>∴ The rate of Interest is 12% per annum</strong>",
