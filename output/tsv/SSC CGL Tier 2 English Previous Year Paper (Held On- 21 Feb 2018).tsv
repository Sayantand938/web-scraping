This however, is not Type A malnutrition that is the calorie and/or micronutrient deficiency of developing nations but Type B malnutrition that is multiple micronutrient depletion. The passage warns that the severity can become worse in newer micronutrient groups like fatty acids and flavonoids are included in the surveys. It claimed that commonly ingested levels are low in developed countries for these micronutrients.<br><strong>The correct sequence will be:</strong><br>Many national surveys reveal that malnutrition is common in developed countries. This is not the calorie and/or micronutrient deficiency associated with developing nations (Type A malnutrition); but multiple micronutrient depletion, usually combined with calorific balance or excess (Type B malnutrition). The incidence and severity of Type B malnutrition will be shown to be worse if newer micronutrient groups such as the essential fatty acids, xanthophylls and flavonoids are included in the surveys. Commonly ingested levels of these micronutrients seem to be far too low in many developed countries.		ENG::Para-Jumble CGL::Mains::008

Read the passage carefully and select the best answer to each question out of the given four alternatives.<br>Vibrant salads, wholesome bites, vegan baking, all vegetarian!” Thus, proclaimed a billboard on a stand placed just outside The Lighthouse Cafe. Well, well, well, I thought to myself, another one of those places designed to attract tourists; can’t be genuine, can it? I couldn’t have been more wrong. I’d embarked on a walking tour of Galway, a city facing the Atlantic, in the Republic of Ireland, and my guide was Billy Murray who told me at the outset that I would be the solitary walker – others had stayed away because of the dismal weather. The weather had indeed been unfriendly, with beating rain, thunder, poor visibility and of course, gray and cold, especially on the Wild Atlantic Way where I had braved the weather and carried on with a coach tour I’d booked earlier, after having spent the previous day driving down to Galway from Dublin. But today the rains had stopped, and the sky was clear but still gray and yet, I found the ambience rather romantic and full of promise. “Of course, we’ll go on that walking tour,” I said to a surprised Billy who led me out of the Tourist Centre in downtown Galway and on to the rain-washed street. At the end of the rather comprehensive tour I asked Billy for advice – where should I eat my lunch? And he’d recommended the Lighthouse Cafe near Lynch’s Castle (now a bank) when I specified that I was vegetarian.<br>It seems there are quite a few local residents who are vegetarian, and more are exploring this choice, mainly because of health and environmental reasons. But the decor inside the restaurant suggested that the owner turned to this choice due to compassion. I remembered then that Billy did mention that Kerry Legh and her spouse, who run the place, practise Sahaj Marga meditation. The lotus flower was a dominant feature of the restaurant’s interior.

Children can also experience impaired cognitive development and stunted growth.According to Finlay and UBC PhD student Eric Brown, malnutrition can be difficult to treat because it affects the good bacteria that live in the gut. People suffering from malnutrition often show signs of a disease known as environmental enteropathy, which is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine and is likely caused by ingesting pathogenic fecal bacteria early in life from a contaminated environment.

148	<strong>Direction: </strong>Read the passage carefully and choose the best answer to each question out of the four alternatives.<br>As the 23rd conference of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bonn shifts into high gear, developing countries including India are focussing on the imperatives of ensuring adequate financing for mitigation and adaptation. They are moving ahead with specific instruments for loss and damage they suffer due to destructive climate-linked events. India's progress in reducing the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP by 20-25% from 2005 levels by 2020, based on the commitment made in Copenhagen in 2009, has been positive. Early studies also suggest that it is on track to achieve the national pledge under the 2015 Paris Agreement for a 33-35% cut in emissions intensity per unit of growth from the same base year (2015) by 2030, and thus heed the 2°C global warming goal. Since this performance is predicated on a growth rate of just over 7%, and the parallel target for 40% share of renewable energy by that year (2030), the national road map is clear. What is not, however, is the impact of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods that would have a bearing on economic growth. It is in this context that the rich countries must give up their rigid approach towards the demands of low and middle-income countries and come to an early resolution on the question of financing of mitigation, adaptation and compensation. Of course, India could further raise its ambition in the use of green technologies and emissions cuts, which would give it the mantle of global climate leadership.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>India has set a target to reduce by 33-35% its emissions intensity per unit of GDP growth in how many years?	10	15	20	5	2	<strong>The correct answer is (2)</strong><br>From the base year of 2015, India has set a target of 33-35% cut in emissions intensity per unit of GDP by 2030, which is 15 years.
