Called “Fairy Chimneys” of Goreme in the Cappadocia region, Turkey, these rock sites are a major tourist attraction. Cappadocia lies in Central Anatolia in Turkey with the Taurus Mountains in the south separating it from the Mediterranean Sea. The rock formations that we see today can be traced back to millions of years. Several volcanic eruptions through deep fractures threw up rocks, lava, ash, and other materials. After the eruption, dense ash covered the entire area. Soon the ejected ash solidified into a soft/porous rock called “tuff”.<br>The soft rocks were exposed to subaerial erosion by wind, water and climatic changes (temperature changes). The rocks expanded in summer as they heated up and broke up in winter as they froze. Added to this, the icy water collected in the cracks led to disintegration. Cappadocia gets heavy rain, and this too has played its part in altering the landscape. Rainwater has created sweeping curves on the sides of the valleys. The rivers washed away the eroded pieces of rocks and the harder rocks stayed on. Today, you see them in different shapes — capped chimneys, pillars, mushrooms, and conical formations.

Read the passage carefully and choose the best answer to each question out of the four alternatives.</strong><br>Volcanic eruptions create beautiful surreal panorama like the unique landscape in Turkey. Here, rock structures of different shapes and sizes are a result of volcanic outbursts. Called “Fairy Chimneys” of Goreme in the Cappadocia region, Turkey, these rock sites are a major tourist attraction. Cappadocia lies in Central Anatolia in Turkey with the Taurus Mountains in the south separating it from the Mediterranean Sea. The rock formations that we see today can be traced back to millions of years. Several volcanic eruptions through deep fractures threw up rocks, lava, ash, and other materials. After the eruption, dense ash covered the entire area. Soon the ejected ash solidified into a soft/porous rock called “tuff”.<br>The soft rocks were exposed to subaerial erosion by wind, water and climatic changes (temperature changes). The rocks expanded in summer as they heated up and broke up in winter as they froze. Added to this, the icy water collected in the cracks led to disintegration. Cappadocia gets heavy rain, and this too has played its part in altering the landscape. Rainwater has created sweeping curves on the sides of the valleys. The rivers washed away the eroded pieces of rocks and the harder rocks stayed on. Today, you see them in different shapes — capped chimneys, pillars, mushrooms, and conical formations. As erosion constantly changes the landscape of the rock structures in Cappadocia, it can pose a danger to the habitation.​<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br><div>Why are there curves on the sides of the valley?</div>	Due to winds	Due to changing temperature	Due to rain water	Due to human activity	3	With context to the passage, it is the rainwater that makes sweeping curves on the sides of the valleys.<br><strong>Thus, option 3 is appropriate.</strong>		ENG::Comprehension CGL::Mains::009

After the mass extinction (65 million years ago), most of the butterflies diverged into many different groups. The butterfly species were placed in seven groups — Papilionidae, Hedylidae, Hesperiidae, Pieridae, Riodinidae, Lycaenidae and Nymphalidae.<br>“Our analyses support swallowtails (Papilionidae) as sister to all other butterflies, followed by skippers (Hesperiidae) and the nocturnal butterflies (Hedylidae) as sister to the remainder,” says the report.<br>The whites (Pieridae) were supported as sister to brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae), blues and metal marks (Lycaenidae and Riodinidae).
