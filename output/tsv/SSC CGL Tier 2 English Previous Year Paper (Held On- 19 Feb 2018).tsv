Ponder is usually followed by over and upon in English grammar.<br>We think over something carefully but we cannot think ‘on’ something that is grammatically incorrect.

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	3	The error is in part 3 of the sentence. It should be ‘across’ instead of ‘cross’. Across is the right word in the context of the sentence. <strong>Across</strong> means expressing position or orientation.<br><strong>Cross</strong> means pass in an opposite or different direction; intersect.

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	2	The error is in part 2 of the sentence. It should be ‘does not’ instead of ‘do not’. Since the sentence is frames in 3<sup>rd</sup> person present tense the word ‘do’ does not fit the context. ‘Do’ means to perform an action and does is the 3<sup>rd</sup> person singular present of the verb ‘do’. So ‘does’ is grammatically correct.		ENG::Spot-the-Error CGL::Mains::006

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	3	The error is in part 3 of the sentence. It should be ‘happens’ instead of ‘happened’. The sentence is framed in present tense.<br>The word ‘happened’ is the past participle of happen which means to occur and ‘happens’ is the present participle of happen. Therefore the correct word in this context is ‘happens’.		ENG::Spot-the-Error CGL::Mains::006

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	3	The error is in <strong>part 3 of the sentence.</strong> The verb ‘help’ is used with infinitive: ‘to move’ or just ‘move’ rather than ‘moving’. The correct sentence would be ‘helps us to move forward in life’.<br>Infinitive is as if the verb phrase puts on the costume of a noun, adjective or adverb and plays the role of a part of speech other than itself.<br>Any verb that is preceded by the word 'to' is an <strong>infinitive</strong>.<br>Therefore ‘to move’ makes grammatical sense here.<br>Hence, <strong>option 3 is correct.</strong>		ENG::Spot-the-Error CGL::Mains::006

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	3	The error is in part 3 of the sentence. It should be ‘effect’ instead of ‘affect’. The word ‘affect’ means to have an effect on; make a difference to. While the word ‘effect’ means a change which is a result or consequence of an action or other cause. Therefore the word <strong>effect</strong> makes more sense in the context of the sentence.

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	3	The error is in part 3 of the sentence. It should be ‘adds’ instead of ‘add’. The verb ‘add’ does not appear to agree with the singular subject ‘a purpose’.

(3)/ No Error (4)	1	2	3	4	1	The error is in part 1 of the sentence. It should be ‘building’ instead of ‘build’. The word building makes more grammatical sense here than build. ‘Building’ is a noun that means the creation or development of something over a period of time.

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	3	The error is in part 3 of the sentence. It appears that the preposition ‘to’ is incorrect in this context.

(3)/ No error (4)	1	2	3	4	3	The error is in part 3 of the sentence. It should be ‘seeking’ rather than ‘seek’.<br>The word ‘seek’ is grammatically incorrect in this context. Seek means an attempt to find something. While seeking is the present participle of seek.

Lucknow’s chikankari is known across the world yet very little research or documentation has been done. Articles or features have appeared off and on but this book is amongst the first of its kind, which aims to document the vast treasure called Chikan.

The narrative more in the nature of a personal journey, with all the quirks and street-smart practicality, makes the book refreshing. As Paola says in the book, it is not a scholarly or academic research but more of a documentation of the world of chikankari. Paola questions the use of chikan as a word for embroidery, highlighting that it has a broader connotation encompassing haute couture, the fine art of making a garment, embroidering it and finishing it with finesse. She is no stranger to chikankari having worked with SEWA and several craftsmen. Her love for white on white embroidery also found a calling in chikan.
