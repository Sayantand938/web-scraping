Even after declining employment, Country K has enough potters to continue contributing equally to the international market.:</strong> From the situation given, it can be inferred that despite the declining employment in the pottery industry in Country K, the country continues to contribute significantly (75%) to the world's pottery market. This implies that even after the decline in employment, Country K has enough potters to continue contributing equally to the international market. <strong>Therefore, the conclusion I can be concluded.</strong><br><strong>II. The local demand of pottery in Country K has substantially decreased leading to less interest among potters:</strong> On the other hand, there is no information provided in the situation about the local demand of pottery in Country K. We cannot assume or infer that the decline in employment is due to a decreased local demand for pottery, as the reduction in employment could be due to other factors, such as increased automation, outsourcing, or a change in manufacturing techniques. <strong>Therefore, conclusion II cannot be concluded.</strong><br><span>Hence, the correct option here is "<strong>3) Only I can be concluded</strong>".</span>		GI::Statement-Conclusion CGL::Mains::021

48	In this question, two statements I and II have been given. These statements may be independent causes or effects of independent causes or a common cause. One of the statements may be the effect of the other statement. Read both statements and select the correct answer.<br>I. Since the past three years, State M has reported a sharp and substantial decline in the state’s agricultural produce.<br>II. In the last five years, there has been an increase in the overall average Rainfall by 6% in State M bringing respite to the farmers.	I is the cause and II is its possible effect	Both I and II are independent causes	II is the cause and I is its possible effect	Both I and II are effects of independent causes	4	Explanation:<br>Statement I indicates a decline in the agricultural produce in State M. Statement II indicates that there has been an increase in average rainfall in State M.<br>It's generally expected that increased rainfall would benefit agricultural produce, assuming all other factors are constant, as it would provide more water for crops. However, this is not always the case, too much rain can also lead to issues such as flooding or waterlogged soil that can negatively impact crops. But there is not enough information given to establish this correlation.<br><strong>It's more reasonable to suggest that both these statements are effects, but they are of independent causes</strong>. The decline in agricultural produce could be due to factors like pests, disease, changes in farming practices, or changes in market demand. The increase in rainfall, on the other hand, could be due to climate change, changes in weather patterns, or other environmental factors.<br>Hence, t<span>he correct option is "<strong>4) Both I and II are effects of independent causes".</strong></span>		GI::Statement-Conclusion CGL::Mains::021

50	<strong>Directions:</strong> A statement is given followed by two inferences I and II. You have to consider the statement to be true even if it seems to be at variance with commonly known facts. You have to decide which of the given inferences, if any, follow from the given statement.<br><strong>Statement: </strong>Many students are addicted to mobile games and this leads to poor academic performance.<br><strong>Inference:</strong><br>I. Many Students are not paying attention to studies due to mobile games.<br>II. It is only because of mobile games that students fail in the examination.	If only II follows	If neither I nor II follows	If both I and II follow	If only I follows	4	<strong>Explanation:</strong><br><strong>I. Many Students are not paying attention to studies due to mobile games:</strong> From the statement given, it can be inferred that many students' addiction to mobile games is affecting their academic performance negatively. This suggests that students are likely not paying enough attention to their studies because they are playing mobile games,<strong> so inference I follows.</strong><br><strong>II. It is only because of mobile games that students fail in the examination:</strong> However, the statement does not imply that mobile games are the only reason students fail in examinations. There could be multiple other factors contributing to a student's failure, such as lack of understanding, insufficient study, personal issues, health problems, etc. <strong>Therefore, inference II does not follow from the statement given.</strong><br><strong>Hence, the correct answer is option 4, i.e., only inference I follow.</strong>		GI::Statement-Conclusion CGL::Mains::021

94	<strong>Direction: Read the given passage and answer the questions that follow.</strong><br>The sage of science, Einstein, was sitting in a depressive and pensive mood one evening. His eyes were brimming with tears. The pain was evident on his face. He peeped out of the window of his room. The sun had set a few minutes back. The sky was filled with a reddish glow. At this sunset, he felt that it was humanity that had sunk into devilish darkness and the reddish glow in the sky was the blood of humanity spilling all over the sky from earth. With tired steps, he walked back to his chair and settled down. It was the 9th of August 1945. Three days back, he had felt the same agony as if someone had torn him apart. He was deeply hurt and depressed when he heard on the radio that America had dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese city, Hiroshima. Today, within three days another bomb was dropped on another city, Nagasaki and lakhs of people had been killed.<br>He had heard that the blast released so much energy that it had paled all past destructions in comparison and death had played out a pitiable dance of destruction. The flames that broke out of the bomb were burning, melting, and exploding buildings. Scared of the heat of the bomb, people had jumped into lakes and rivers, but the water was boiling and the people too were burnt and killed. The animals in the water were already boiled to death. Animals, trees, herbs, fragrant flowering plants were all turned into ashes. The atomic energy destruction had just not stopped there. It had entered the atmosphere there and had spread radiation that would affect people for generations to come and would also bring about destructive irreversible biological change in animals and plants.<br>As the news of the atomic attack reached Einstein, and he became aware of the glaring horror of the abuse of atomic energy, his distress and restlessness knew no bounds. He could not control himself and picked up his violin to turn his mind on to other things. While playing the violin, he tried to dissolve his distress in its sad notes, but couldn’t. He was burning on the embers of destruction; his heart was filled with an ocean of agony and tears just continued streaming uncontrollably out of his eyes. Night had fallen. His daughter came up and asked him to eat something as he had not taken anything for the last four days. His voice was restrained and he said, “I don’t feel like eating.”<br>He could not sleep that night. Lying down, he was thinking how he had drawn the attention of the then American President Roosevelt towards the destructive powers of an atomic bomb. He had thought that this would be used to scare Hitler and put an end to the barbarism that Hitler was up to. However, Roosevelt kept him in the dark and made false promises. Eventually, he had abused Einstein’s equation of E = mc2 that resulted in the destructive experiments. His actions had made science and scientists as murderers. Einstein kept on thinking for a long time. Eventually, he slipped into sleep. When he woke up at dawn, there was a new dawn in him too. The atomic threat had transformed his heart.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>Why did Einstein refuse to eat?

At this sunset, he felt that it was humanity that had sunk into devilish darkness and the reddish glow in the sky was the blood of humanity spilling all over the sky from earth. With tired steps, he walked back to his chair and settled down. It was the 9th of August 1945. Three days back, he had felt the same agony as if someone had torn him apart.

His daughter came up and asked him to eat something as he had not taken anything for the last four days. His voice was restrained and he said, “I don’t feel like eating.”<br>He could not sleep that night. Lying down, he was thinking how he had drawn the attention of the then American President Roosevelt towards the destructive powers of an atomic bomb. He had thought that this would be used to scare Hitler and put an end to the barbarism that Hitler was up to. However, Roosevelt kept him in the dark and made false promises.

129	The Reserve Bank of India introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework for NBFC-MFI on ________.	10 December 2015	2 December 2011	8 December 2013	5 December 2012	2	The correct answer is <u><strong>Option 2</strong></u>.<br><span><strong><span><u>Key Points</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li><strong>One key milestone</strong> in the evolution of this regulatory framework was the<strong> constitution of the committee</strong> under the <strong>Chairmanship of Shri Y. H. Malegam. </strong>Based on the recommendations of this Committee,<strong> RBI</strong> introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework for<strong> NBFC-MFIs</strong> in <strong>December 2011.</strong><li>The regulations prescribed the eligibility criteria for microfinance loans which was linked to core features of microfinance i.e., lending of small amounts to borrowers belonging to low-income groups without collateral, with flexible repayment schedules. Besides, the regulations laid special emphasis on protection of borrowers and fair practices in lending such as <strong>transparency in charges, ceilings on margins and interest rates, non-coercive methods of recovery, measures to contain multiple lending and over-indebtedness.</strong></ul><strong>​</strong><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li><strong>Indian microfinance sector</strong> has witnessed phenomenal growth over past two decades in terms of increase in both – <strong>the number of institutions providing micro finance as also the quantum of credit made available to the micro finance customers.</strong><li>Presently, <strong>micro credit</strong> is delivered through a variety of institutional channels viz.<strong>, scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), regional rural banks (RRBs), cooperative banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs),</strong> <strong>Section 8 companies and microfinance institutions (MFIs) registered as NBFCs as well as in other forms.</strong> <strong>The small finance banks (SFBs)</strong> are the latest game in the town.<li>The institutional landscape of the microfinance sector has also changed significantly after licensing of Small Finance Banks. One out of two entities which was granted approval for starting a universal bank in<strong> 2014</strong> was an <strong>NBFC-MFI,</strong> while eight out of ten entities granted approval for starting<strong> Small Finance Banks in 2016 </strong>were<strong> NBFC-MFIs.</strong><li>This, apart from further consolidation in the sector, has led to significant changes in the market dynamics with the share of specialized MFIs standing at a little over<strong> 30 per cent as on June 30, 2021</strong> in the overall gross loan portfolio of around <strong>₹2.14 lakh crore in the sector.</strong> Thus, <strong>micro finance, as a financial activity can no longer said to be a bastion of specialized MFIs.</strong><li>However, the current regulatory framework, which was put in place with the objective of making credit available to low-income households and to protect borrowers from harsh recovery practices of the lenders, is applicable only to NBFC-MFIs, whereas other lenders, who now have a share of around 70 per cent in the microfinance portfolio are not subjected to similar regulatory conditions.<li>This has created a non-level playing field, posing difficulties for customers and has resulted in emergence of differing practices within the sector. While one would have expected<li>that other lenders would also be guided by the intent of the abovementioned regulations applicable to NBFC- MFIs, that has not happened.<li>Mostly, there have been three distinct sets of criticisms against micro finance lenders –<ul><li><strong>They lead their borrowers into debt-trap like situations</strong><li><strong>They charge usurious rates of interest often disproportionate to their funding and operational costs</strong><li><strong>They deploy harsh recovery methods leading to distress amongst borrowers.</strong></ul><li>These are issues which need to be critically introspected and addressed by the lenders to prevent recurrence of the crisis episodes. The emerging dynamics in the microfinance sector as well as the concerns around customer protection therefore call for a review of the regulations so that all the regulated entities engaged in micro finance pursue the goal of customer protection within a well-calibrated and harmonized set-up.</ul>		GK::Economics CGL::Mains::021
