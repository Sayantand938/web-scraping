Your child says one thing, your parent says something else, and your adult, rational mind says something else. The child says ‘enjoy’. For the child, this moment is the only moment; he has no other considerations. The child is spontaneous but unaware of the consequences - unaware of past, unaware of future. He lives in the moment. He enjoys - but his enjoyment is not creative, cannot be creative. He delights - but life cannot be lived only through delight. You cannot remain a child forever. You will have to learn many things because you are not alone here... The child has to be disciplined - and that’s where the parent comes in. The parental voice in you is the voice of the society, culture, civilization; the voice that makes you capable of living in a world where you are not alone - where there are many individuals with conflicting ambitions, where there is much struggle for survival, where there is much conflict.

An earth observation Cartosat-2 series satellite and two other nano satellites were the only Indian satellites launched; the remaining were from the United States, Israel, the UAE, the Netherlands, Kazakhstan and Switzerland. Of the 101 foreign satellites launched, 96 were from the U.S. and one each from the other five countries. Till now Russia held the record of launching 37 satellites in a single mission, in 2014, while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the U.S. launched 29 satellites in one go in 2013. Last June, ISRO had come close to NASA’s record by launching 20 satellites in one mission. But ISRO views the launch not as a mission to set a world record but as an opportunity to make full use of the capacity of the launch vehicle. The launch is particularly significant as ISRO now cements its position as a key player in the lucrative commercial space launch market by providing a cheaper yet highly reliable alternative. At an orbital altitude of around 500 km, the vehicle takes about 90 minutes to complete one orbit. Though ISRO had sufficient time to put the satellites into orbit, it accomplished the task in about 12 minutes. With the focus on ensuring that no two satellites collided with each other, the satellites were injected in pairs in opposite directions. Successive pairs of satellites were launched once the vehicle rotated by a few degrees, thereby changing the separation angle and time of separation to prevent any collision. Besides setting the record for the most number of satellites launched in a single mission, the Indian space agency has launched two nanosatellites weighing less than 10 kg.

An earth observation Cartosat-2 series satellite and two other nano satellites were the only Indian satellites launched; the remaining were from the United States, Israel, the UAE, the Netherlands, Kazakhstan and Switzerland. Of the 101 foreign satellites launched, 96 were from the U.S. and one each from the other five countries. Till now Russia held the record of launching 37 satellites in a single mission, in 2014, while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the U.S. launched 29 satellites in one go in 2013. Last June, ISRO had come close to NASA’s record by launching 20 satellites in one mission. But ISRO views the launch not as a mission to set a world record but as an opportunity to make full use of the capacity of the launch vehicle. The launch is particularly significant as ISRO now cements its position as a key player in the lucrative commercial space launch market by providing a cheaper yet highly reliable alternative. At an orbital altitude of around 500 km, the vehicle takes about 90 minutes to complete one orbit. Though ISRO had sufficient time to put the satellites into orbit, it accomplished the task in about 12 minutes. With the focus on ensuring that no two satellites collided with each other, the satellites were injected in pairs in opposite directions. Successive pairs of satellites were launched once the vehicle rotated by a few degrees, thereby changing the separation angle and time of separation to prevent any collision. Besides setting the record for the most number of satellites launched in a single mission, the Indian space agency has launched two nanosatellites weighing less than 10 kg. It is a technology demonstrator for a new class of satellites called ISRO nanosatellites (INS).

But when she supports the ban on firecrackers because of the pollution it creates, the earthworms once again flail desperately, not by quoting statistics or making logical arguments to refute her point but by muck-raking. ‘Don’t mess with our ancient traditions,’ they say. I would like to tell them that if we stuck to all our traditions just because they’re ancient then we should still be pushing widows into funeral pyres to commit sati and get our children married off at the age of eight.

133	<strong>Read the passage carefully and select the best answer to each question out of the given four alternatives.</strong><br>The first thing is that the rich people of the world should start living in communes. Let those communes be of the rich! So they will not be dragged down from their standard of life, their comforts, and their luxuries. Let there be, around the world, hundreds of communes of rich people – that is, rich communes. And to me, wealth is a certain kind of creativity. If five thousand rich people who have all created wealth individually are together, they can create wealth a millionfold. Their standard will not go lower; their standard could go even higher. Or they can start sharing. They can start inviting people who are not rich but who are creative in some other way, who will enhance the life of their commune although they may be poor. Five thousand rich people, together with their genius for creating wealth, are capable of creating so much wealth that they can invite thousands of other people who may not be rich in the sense of being wealthy, but who may be rich as painters, poets, dancers, singers. What are you going to do only with wealth? You cannot play music on money; you cannot dance just because you have so much cash in the bank. And these rich communes can start becoming bigger, absorbing more and more creative people. They can make beautiful places all around the world, and slowly, new people can be absorbed.<br>For example, you will need plumbers, however rich you may be; you will need mechanics; technicians; you will need shoemakers. Invite them – and they come to you not as servants, but as members of the commune. Slowly, we can transform the whole world – without any bloodshed and without any dictatorship. A communism that comes out of love, out of intelligence, out of generosity, will be real. A communism that comes through force is going to be unreal. There is not a single man in the world, howsoever poor, who has nothing to contribute. Around the world all the rich communes will need people; and slowly, slowly your commune will become bigger and bigger.<br>The rich will not become poor, but the poor will become rich, and respectable, and equal – in no way inferior to anybody else – because they are also functioning in the same way as anybody else. And whatever they are doing is needed as much as anybody else’s expertise is needed.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>Suggest a suitable topic to the passage.	Wealth is creativity	Poor are not our servant	Share your money	Making the whole world rich	4	The whole passage states the way how to make the whole world rich.
