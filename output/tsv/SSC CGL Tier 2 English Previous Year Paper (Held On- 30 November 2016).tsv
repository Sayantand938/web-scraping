She said that they thought of selling the house but decided not to.	She said that they have been thinking of selling the house but decided not to.	She said that they had been thinking of selling the house but they had decided not to.	4	The correct answer is: <strong>She said that they had been thinking of selling the house but they had decided not to</strong>.<br><span><strong><span><u>Key Points</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>In the given sentence, "She said" is the reporting verb that indicates that the sentence is indirect speech. The reported speech includes two clauses - "We were thinking of selling the house" and "We had decided not to."<li>The sentence in the Direct Speech is in <strong>Past Simple</strong>. Therefore, the sentence in the Indirect Speech should be in <strong>Past Perfect Tense</strong>.<li>Past Simple <strong>(Subject + V2 + Object)</strong> should be converted into Past Perfect <strong>(Subject + had + V3 + Object)</strong>.<li>In the indirect speech, the verb tense changes to reflect that the original statement was made in the past. Therefore, "were thinking" changes to "had been thinking" to show that the thinking process had already taken place before the time the statement was made. Similarly, "had decided" remains in the past perfect tense.<li>Moreover, the pronoun "we" is replaced with "they" to indicate that the speaker is reporting what someone else said.</ul>Therefore, the correct transformation of the direct speech to indirect speech is: <em><strong>She said that they had been thinking of selling the house but they had decided not to.</strong></em>		ENG::Narration CGL::Mains::001

When we report this sentence, we need to change the verb tense to the<strong> conditional form of the past tense</strong>, "would leave," to reflect the backshifted tense.<li>Additionally, the pronoun "your" needs to be changed to "my" to reflect the perspective of the reporting speaker. And the phrase "if you do not go at once" (present tense) needs to be changed to "if I did not go at that moment" (past tense) to reflect the backshifted tense and the reporting speaker's perspective.</ul>Therefore, the correct answer is: <em><strong>He told me that my train would leave if I did not go that moment.</strong></em>		ENG::Narration CGL::Mains::001

Well-developed vegetation also allows bank soils to absorb extra water during spring runoff, releasing it later during drier months, thus improving late-summer stream flows.<br>In many parts of the arid West, trees and shrubs are found only in riparian areas. Woody plants are very important as winter cover for many wildlife species, including upland game birds such as pheasants and turkeys. Often this winter cover is the greatest single factor limiting game bird populations. Woody vegetation also provides hiding cover and browse for many other species of birds and mammals, both game and nongame.<br>Dead trees ("snags") are an integral part of streamside habitats and should be left standing whenever possible. Woodpeckers, nuthatches, brown creepers, and other birds eat the insects that decompose the wood. These insects usually pose no threat to nearby living trees. Occasionally a disease organism or misuse of pesticides will weaken or kill a stand of trees.

200	<strong>Direction: Read the following passage carefully and choose the most appropriate answer to the question out of the four alternatives.</strong><br>The human eye is a complex part of the body that is used for seeing. Eyes enable people to perform daily tasks and to learn about the world that surrounds them.<br>Sight, or vision, is a rapidly occurring process that involves continuous interaction between the eye, the nervous system, and the brain. When someone looks at an object, what he really sees is the light reflected from the object. This reflected light passes through the lens and falls on the retina of the eye. Here the light induces nerve impulses that travel through the optic nerve to the brain and then over other nerves to muscles and glands.<br>The eye is similar to a television camera. Both the eye and the television camera convert light energy to electrical energy. The eye converts light to nerve impulses that are interpreted by the brain as the sense perception called sight.
