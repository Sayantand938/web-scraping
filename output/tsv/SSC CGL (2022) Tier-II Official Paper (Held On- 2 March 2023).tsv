98	<strong>Read the given passage and answer the questions that follow.</strong><br>We sit in the last row, bumped about but free of stares. The bus rolls out of the dull crossroads of the city, and we are soon in the open countryside, with fields of sunflowers as far as the eye can see, their heads all facing us. Where there is no water, the land reverts to the desert. While still on level ground, we see in the distance the tall range of the Mount Bogda, abrupt like a shining prism laid horizontally on the desert surface. It is over 5,000 metres high, and the peaks are under permanent snow, in powerful contrast to the flat desert all around. Heaven lake lies part of the way up this range, about 2,000 metres above sea level, at the foot of one of the highest snow-peaks.<br>As the bus climbs, the sky, brilliant before, grows overcast. I have brought nothing warm to wear. It is all down at the hotel in Urumqi. Rain begins to fall. The man behind me is eating overpoweringly smelly goat’s cheese. The bus window leaks inhospitably but reveals a beautiful view. We have passed quickly from the desert through arable land to pasture and the ground is now green with grass, the slopes dark with pine. A few cattle drink at a clear stream flowing past moss-covered stones; it is a Constable landscape. The stream changes into a white torrent, and as we climb higher I wish more and more that I had brought with me something warmer than the pair of shorts that have served me so well in the desert. The stream (which, we are told, rises in Heaven Lake) disappears, and we continue our slow ascent. About noon, we arrive at Heaven Lake, and look for a place to stay at the foot, which is the resort area. We get a room in a small cottage, and I am happy to note that there are thick quilts on the bed.<br>Standing outside the cottage, we survey our surroundings.

140	Which among the following is incorrect about Laser Printers?	Uses laser lights for producing dots to form characters on a page	Cannot print multiple copies at a time	Fast speed	Supports multiple fonts and sizes	2	<strong>Option 2) Cannot print multiple copies at a time is incorrect about Laser Printers.</strong><br><ul><li>Laser printers can print multiple copies at a time by either using manual duplex printing or automatic duplex printing.<li>In manual duplex printing, the user has to manually flip the paper to print on both sides, while in automatic duplex printing, the printer itself prints on both sides without the user's intervention</ul><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>Uses laser lights for producing dots to form characters on a page: This is true. Laser printers use a laser beam to create an electrostatic image, or "latent image," on a rotating metal drum called a "photoreceptor." The laser beam is directed onto the drum by a series of mirrors and lenses, and it causes the drum's surface to become electrically charged in certain areas. Then, the drum is coated with toner (a fine powder) that sticks to the charged areas, forming the image. Finally, the toner is transferred to the paper and fused onto it using heat.<li>Fast speed: This is true. Laser printers are known for their fast printing speed, especially when compared to inkjet printers. They can print up to 25-50 pages per minute (ppm) depending on the model and complexity of the document.<li>Supports multiple fonts and sizes: This is true. Laser printers support multiple fonts and sizes, which is one of their advantages over older printing technologies such as dot matrix printers.<li>The printer driver software installed on the computer sends the fonts and sizes information to the printer, and the printer uses it to produce the printed output</ul>		GK::Undefined CGL::Mains::019

This option is different from shading, which specifically refers to changing the color behind the selected text.<li>Changing the color of the selected text refers to changing the font color of the text itself. This option is different from shading, which specifically refers to changing the color behind the text.<li>Making the text pop by highlighting it can be achieved by using shading, which adds a background color or pattern to the selected text to make it stand out from the surrounding text.<li>In summary, the shading option in MS-Word 365 is used to change the color behind the selected text.</ul>		GK::Undefined CGL::Mains::019

Trojan self-replicate and infects other files.	Trojan spreads through user interaction such as opening an email attachment or downloading and executing a file from the Internet.	3	<strong>The incorrect statement is 3) Trojan self-replicate and infects other files.</strong><br><strong>Explanation:</strong><br><ul><li>This statement 3 is incorrect.

A Trojan is a type of malware that looks like a legitimate software, but actually performs malicious actions on the victim's computer.<br>This statement 2 is also correct. Some Trojans create backdoors on the victim's computer, which allow malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the system and carry out malicious activities.<li>This statement 4 is correct. Trojans typically spread through user interaction, such as opening an email attachment or downloading and executing a file from the Internet.<li>Once a Trojan is executed on the victim's computer, it can carry out various malicious actions such as stealing sensitive information, deleting files, or creating backdoors for other malware to enter the system.<li>In summary, the incorrect statement is 3) Trojan self-replicate and infects other files.</ul>		GK::Undefined CGL::Mains::019
144	The memory unit that communicates directly with the CPU is called _______ memory.	cache	backup	main	auxiliary	1	<strong>The correct answer is <u>cache</u></strong><br><strong><u><span><strong><span><u>Key Points</u></span></strong></span></u></strong><br><ul><li>The cache memory is a high-speed memory type that resides between the CPU and the main memory (RAM).<li>It's used to temporarily store data that's frequently accessed by the CPU.<li>Since cache memory is faster than RAM, it helps to reduce the time it takes for the CPU to get data and instructions.<li>When the CPU needs to read or write to a location in main memory, it first checks whether a copy of that data is in the cache. If so, the CPU immediately reads from or writes to the cache, which is much faster than reading from or writing to main memory.<li>So, in the context of your question, cache memory is the memory unit that communicates directly with the CPU.<li>While main memory (RAM) does also communicate with the CPU, it doesn't do so as directly or quickly as cache memory.<li>Backup and auxiliary memory, on the other hand, refer to additional or secondary storage that is not directly accessed by the CPU, such as external hard drives, tapes, or cloud storage.</ul><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>Cache memory, is a high-speed memory unit that stores frequently accessed data and instructions to reduce the access time to main memory.<li>Backup memory is used to create copies of data or to store data for safekeeping in case of a system failure or other issues.<li>Auxiliary memory refers to secondary storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, or flash drives, which are used to store data for long-term use.</ul>NOTE:-<br>Option 3, "main" memory, refers to the primary storage or system memory in a computer, typically RAM (Random Access Memory). While it is true that the CPU can and does communicate directly with main memory, it's not the most immediate form of memory to the CPU.<br>The reason option 1, "cache" memory, is more accurate is because cache is a smaller, faster memory that stores copies of the most frequently used data from main memory. It is located closer to the CPU and offers quicker access time, allowing the CPU to process data more efficiently.<br>So, while the CPU communicates with both types of memory, cache memory is designed to be the immediate, go-between memory that the CPU uses before accessing the slightly slower main memory.
