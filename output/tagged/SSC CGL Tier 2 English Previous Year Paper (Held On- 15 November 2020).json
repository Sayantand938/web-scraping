    "Question": "<strong>Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.</strong><br>Since September, at least 25 people have died and thousands have been made homeless. Every state and territory in Australia has experienced fires this summer. But the biggest fires burn along stretches of the eastern and southern coast, where most of the population lives. This includes areas around Sydney and Adelaide.<br>More than 6.3 million hectares (63,000 sq km or 15.6 million acres) have been burned so far – one hectare is roughly the size of a sports field. To put that in perspective, around 800,000 hectares were engulfed in a bush fire in 2018 in California.<br>Australia has always experienced bushfires – it has a \"fire season\". But this year they are a lot worse than normal.<br>Fires are usually caused by lightning strikes or accidentally by a spark – but some fires are also started deliberately. This year, a natural weather phenomenon known as the ‘Indian Ocean Dipole’ has meant a hot, dry spell across the country. This year, Australia twice set a new temperature record: an average maximum of 41.9°C was recorded on 18 December. That comes on top of a long period of drought.<br>Scientists have long warned that this hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense.<br>The more extreme weather patterns and higher temperatures increase the risk of bushfires and allow them to spread faster and wider.<br>Firefighters are spraying water and fire retardant from planes and helicopters as well as from the ground. But fighting bush fires is extremely difficult and often authorities have to focus on just stopping the spread, rather than putting the fire out. The spread can for instance be best contained by digging earth boundaries to stop the flames from spreading. The priority is saving lives.<br>Professional firefighters are the first in line to battle the flames, but they are outnumbered by the thousands of volunteers. Three of them have died. There's also help coming from abroad: the US, Canada and New Zealand have sent firefighters to help. Australia's police, military and navy are involved in rescue and evacuation efforts. While people can flee the fires and are being evacuated if need be, the flames are devastating wildlife in the affected areas. One study estimated that half a billion animals have died in New South Wales alone.<br>Zookeepers take animals home to save them from fire, but the fires don't only kill animals directly, they also destroy the habitat, leaving the survivors vulnerable even when the fires have gone. So the true scale of loss isn't yet clear. Experts say more than 100,000 cows and sheep may also have been lost, which is devastating for farmers.<br>Each state runs its own emergency operation, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised better funding for fire-fighting and payouts for volunteer firefighters, and an additional A$2billion ($1.4billion; £1billion) for the recovery.<br>But the national government has come under strong criticism from its opponents that it has not been doing enough against climate change. The country is one of the world's biggest per-capita greenhouse gas emitters but under international agreements, it has committed itself to reduction targets.<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>Which statement is NOT true according to the passage?",
    "OP1": "Around 800,000 hectares have been destroyed due to a bush fire in Australia.",
    "OP2": "Australia is one of the world's biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters.",
    "OP3": "Zookeepers take animals home to save them from fire.",
    "OP4": "The volunteers outnumber the professional fire fighters in Australia.",

    "Question": "<strong>Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.</strong><br>The stark observation made in the Economic Survey of 2015-16 that “Indian agriculture, is in a way, a victim of its own past success – especially the green revolution”, shows the dark reality of the agriculture sector at present and the havoc that has been wrecked by the green revolution.<br>The green revolution, which is often characterised by the introduction of a high-yielding variety of seeds and fertilizers, undoubtedly increased the productivity of land considerably. But the growth in productivity has been stagnant in recent years, resulting in a significant decline in the income of farmers. There have also been negative environmental effects in the form of depleting water table, emission of greenhouse gases, and the contamination of surface and groundwater. Needless to say, the agriculture sector is in a state of distress, which is severely affecting peasants and marginal farmers, and urgent policy interventions are required to protect their interests.<br>The government has responded to the problem by constituting a panel, which will recommend ways to double the income of farmers by 2022. While this may be an overly ambitious target if we want to boost stagnated agricultural growth a shift has to be made from the food security of the nation to the income security of the farmers. However, there are many hurdles that have to be crossed if we want to achieve this objective.<br>The first major barrier to overcome is declining productivity. Data from 2013 reveals that India’s average yield of cereal per hectare is far less than that of many countries (including several low-income countries), but the difference is huge when compared to China. For instance, our average yield per hectare is 39% below that of China and for rice, this figure is 46%. Even Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia fare better than India in case of rice yield.

This option aligns with the context of the sentence, as it suggests a cause-and-effect relationship between becoming a minister and the subsequent decision regarding his relatives.<li><strong>In case</strong>: This option suggests a precautionary action taken in anticipation of a possible event.

Here's the reasoning:<ul><li><strong>Sentence D</strong> presents the initial factual information about a newly discovered chamber in the Egyptian pyramid, giving us a starting point by describing its length.<li><strong>Sentence C</strong> follows by comparing the size of this newly found chamber to the Grand Gallery, which establishes a connection with a known entity within the pyramid structure. This comparison helps to further contextualize the size and significance of the chamber, making it a logical follow-up after introducing the chamber's existence and size.<li><strong>Sentence A</strong> then explains a crucial characteristic about this chamber: it is inaccessible because it lacks a passage that leads to it. This detail progresses naturally from the introduction and comparison of the chamber since after learning about its existence and how big it is, readers would naturally be curious about its accessibility and purpose.<li>Lastly, <strong>Sentence B</strong> provides a speculative comment on the purpose or lack thereof, of the chamber. It suggests a possible reason for the chamber's presence, rounding off the discussion by addressing a question that would logically arise after learning of the chamber's inaccessibility.</ul><li>Putting it all together, <strong>DCAB</strong> forms a coherent paragraph that introduces the chamber <strong>(D)</strong>, provides additional information on its size and relation to known structures <strong>(C),</strong> explains an intriguing characteristic related to its accessibility <strong>(A)</strong>, and concludes with speculation on its purpose <strong>(B)</strong>. This sequence effectively takes the reader from introduction to details to a speculative conclusion in a logical manner.</ul>Therefore, the correct answer is:<strong> DCAB</strong>.",
