And this is despite the surge in open mics and more stand-ups coming in.<br>Last year, new-age Indian comedy’s reputation came under strain when allegations under the #MeToo movement exposed a darker side of the circuit. Since then, the big three comedy groups: All India Bakchod, SNG Comedy and East India Comedy, have either disbanded or had founding members quit.<br>Jeeya Sethi, a leading comedian says, “It’s a good thing that these -collectives have died because they mostly had men with no women being showcased.”<br>Sethi adds saying that it isn’t as easy as it sounds. “In a fledgling industry, a viral YouTube video isn’t a sign that you’ve made it”. Craft takes time. Every comic who does two open mics calls himself a comedian. In my opinion, you have to do comedy for more than 20 years to be a comic. It takes at least five years to find your voice.”<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>Sethi believes that-<br>1. The road to success is only through YouTube.<br>2. A a viral YouTube video is a sign of success.<br>3. Comedy is an art form and takes hard work and patience.<br>4. The true comic artist takes years to find one’s voice.",
