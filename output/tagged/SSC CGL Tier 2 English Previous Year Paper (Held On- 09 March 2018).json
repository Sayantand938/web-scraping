Here, rock structures of different shapes and sizes are a result of volcanic outbursts. Called “Fairy Chimneys” of Goreme in the Cappadocia region, Turkey, these rock sites are a major tourist attraction. Cappadocia lies in Central Anatolia in Turkey with the Taurus Mountains in the south separating it from the Mediterranean Sea. The rock formations that we see today can be traced back to millions of years. Several volcanic eruptions through deep fractures threw up rocks, lava, ash, and other materials. After the eruption, dense ash covered the entire area. Soon the ejected ash solidified into a soft/porous rock called “tuff”.<br>The soft rocks were exposed to subaerial erosion by wind, water and climatic changes (temperature changes). The rocks expanded in summer as they heated up and broke up in winter as they froze. Added to this, the icy water collected in the cracks led to disintegration. Cappadocia gets heavy rain, and this too has played its part in altering the landscape. Rainwater has created sweeping curves on the sides of the valleys. The rivers washed away the eroded pieces of rocks and the harder rocks stayed on. Today, you see them in different shapes — capped chimneys, pillars, mushrooms, and conical formations. As erosion constantly changes the landscape of the rock structures in Cappadocia, it can pose a danger to the habitation.​<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br><div>How old are these rock formations?​</div>",

    "Question": "<strong>A passage is given with five questions following it. Read the passage carefully and select the best answer to each question out of the given four alternatives.</strong><br>There is exciting news for butterfly enthusiasts. By studying 207 species of butterflies, scientists have created an evolutionary tree painting the detailed picture of butterfly relationships and evolution over time.<br>An international team of lepidopterists carried out DNA studies and carbon dating analysis to understand the age and characteristics of butterflies. By comparing and merging previous studies on butterflies, the researchers were able to create the new bigger and better evolutionary tree.<br>“We still have a long way to go, but this is the first comprehensive map of butterfly evolution,” said Akito Y. Kawahara, associate professor at the Florida Museum of Natural History in a release. “Lots of previous studies cover butterfly evolution on smaller scales — by locality or taxon — but surprisingly few have reached across the breadth of butterfly diversity.” Dr. Kawahara is the corresponding author of the paper published in Current Biology.<br>The report also supported previous studies that butterflies originated around 119 million years ago in the late Cretaceous period. After the mass extinction (65 million years ago), most of the butterflies diverged into many different groups. The butterfly species were placed in seven groups — Papilionidae, Hedylidae, Hesperiidae, Pieridae, Riodinidae, Lycaenidae and Nymphalidae.<br>“Our analyses support swallowtails (Papilionidae) as sister to all other butterflies, followed by skippers (Hesperiidae) and the nocturnal butterflies (Hedylidae) as sister to the remainder,” says the report.<br>The whites (Pieridae) were supported as sister to brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae), blues and metal marks (Lycaenidae and Riodinidae). Previously, swallowtails and birdwings were believed to have a common ancestor but the new study showed that they feed on different plants. “That tells us that butterflies and plants may have evolved together,” Dr.Kawahara added. They also studied the association of butterflies with ants. Some butterfly larvae secrete sugars that serve as a meal for ants and the ant in return protects the larva from other predators. This is a well-studied symbiotic relationship. The scientists report that most of the blue butterflies and hair streaks and some of the metal mark butterflies exhibit this behaviour. “We [India] have about one-fifth of the known moths and butterflies represented in Indian collections (3,800 out of an estimated 20,000 species). The only way they could undertake the study was the fact that they have access to a good collection.

In the Nalut district of the Tripolitania region, Ghadames, an oasis town is known as the “pearl of the desert”. It is one of the oldest pre-Saharan cities and a grand example of a traditional settlement. Flying over, I was surprised to see just houses and more houses. There didn’t seem to be any pathways or alleys. Puzzled I flew down to investigate. I found that each house is built in such a way that it hangs over the alleys creating an underground network of passages. The ground floor of the house is used to store supplies, the next floor is for the use of the family and the open-air terraces are reserved for women. They were talking a language I did not understand. I later learned it was Ghadam's, a Berber language.<br>Towards the end of the month, for three days the old city of Ghadames comes alive with feasting, singing, and dancing. It happens at the end of the date harvest. When all the work is done, the people head to the city’s World Heritage-listed old quarter to eat dates and celebrate. The people of the old quarter moved out in the mid-1980s and live in the modern town. But, on this occasion, they return to their family homes in the old city. They throw open the doors for singing, dancing, and other festivities. The covered alleys provide shelter from the hot Sahara sun.​<br><br><strong><b>Question:</b></strong><br>‘The Berber’ refers to:",
