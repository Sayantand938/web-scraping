While it's possible, the statement about the rising fuel prices doesn't specifically attribute the rise to taxation policies, nor does it imply that taxes have remained unchanged. It's an assumption without direct support from the statement.<br><strong>Inference II:</strong> This suggests that international market inflation affects fuel prices, which is a common and plausible reason for changes in fuel prices, given that they often correlate with international oil market trends. However, the original statement does not specifically mention international market conditions affecting the prices. It's again an assumption, though somewhat reasonable.<br>Since neither inference can be directly concluded from the statement given.<br>Hence, the correct answer is <strong>Option 3: Neither inference I nor II.</strong>",
