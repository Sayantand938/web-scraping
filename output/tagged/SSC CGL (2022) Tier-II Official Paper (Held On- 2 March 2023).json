Where there is no water, the land reverts to the desert. While still on level ground, we see in the distance the tall range of the Mount Bogda, abrupt like a shining prism laid horizontally on the desert surface. It is over 5,000 metres high, and the peaks are under permanent snow, in powerful contrast to the flat desert all around. Heaven lake lies part of the way up this range, about 2,000 metres above sea level, at the foot of one of the highest snow-peaks.<br>As the bus climbs, the sky, brilliant before, grows overcast. I have brought nothing warm to wear. It is all down at the hotel in Urumqi. Rain begins to fall. The man behind me is eating overpoweringly smelly goat’s cheese. The bus window leaks inhospitably but reveals a beautiful view. We have passed quickly from the desert through arable land to pasture and the ground is now green with grass, the slopes dark with pine. A few cattle drink at a clear stream flowing past moss-covered stones; it is a Constable landscape. The stream changes into a white torrent, and as we climb higher I wish more and more that I had brought with me something warmer than the pair of shorts that have served me so well in the desert. The stream (which, we are told, rises in Heaven Lake) disappears, and we continue our slow ascent. About noon, we arrive at Heaven Lake, and look for a place to stay at the foot, which is the resort area.

Heaven Lake is long, sardine-shaped and fed by snowmelt from a stream at its head. The lake is an intense blue, surrounded on all sides by green mountain walls, dotted with distant sheep. At the head of the lake, beyond the delta of the inflowing stream, is a massive snow-capped peak which dominates the vista; it is part of a series of peaks that culminate, a little out of view, in Mount Bogda itself.<br>For those who live in the resort, there is a small mess-hall by the shore.

    "Question": "Read the following passage and answer the questions given after it.<br>From January 28 to February 4, 2023, a Chinese-operated, large white high-altitude balloon was seen in North American airspace, including Alaska, western Canada, and the contiguous United States. The American and Canadian militaries asserted that the balloon was for surveillance, while the Chinese government maintained it was a civilian meteorological research airship that had been blown off course. Analysts said that the balloon's flight path and structural characteristics made it dissimilar from those which have typically been used for meteorological research. The U.S. Department of State said that the balloon was capable of locating electronic communication devices, including mobile phones and radios, and that American U-2 reconnaissance aircraft deployed to track the balloon in the air revealed that the balloon carried antennas and other equipment \"clearly for intelligence surveillance and inconsistent with the equipment on board weather balloons.\" The State Department said that the spy balloon was part of a global Chinese military-directed surveillance effort in which Chinese spy balloons have flown over more than 40 nations in five continents. On February 4, the U.S. Air Force shot down the balloon over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina, on the order of U.S. President Joe Biden. Debris from the wreckage was recovered and sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. The incident increased U.S.-China tensions. The incident prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to delay a diplomatic visit to Beijing, which was set to be his first since 2018. It also further strained Canada–China relations, as Canada summoned the Chinese ambassador because of the violation of Canadian airspace.

    "OP4": "Supports multiple fonts and sizes",
    "Answer": "2",
    "Solution": "<strong>Option 2) Cannot print multiple copies at a time is incorrect about Laser Printers.</strong><br><ul><li>Laser printers can print multiple copies at a time by either using manual duplex printing or automatic duplex printing.<li>In manual duplex printing, the user has to manually flip the paper to print on both sides, while in automatic duplex printing, the printer itself prints on both sides without the user's intervention</ul><span><strong><span><u>Additional Information</u></span></strong></span><br><ul><li>Uses laser lights for producing dots to form characters on a page: This is true. Laser printers use a laser beam to create an electrostatic image, or \"latent image,\" on a rotating metal drum called a \"photoreceptor.\" The laser beam is directed onto the drum by a series of mirrors and lenses, and it causes the drum's surface to become electrically charged in certain areas. Then, the drum is coated with toner (a fine powder) that sticks to the charged areas, forming the image. Finally, the toner is transferred to the paper and fused onto it using heat.<li>Fast speed: This is true. Laser printers are known for their fast printing speed, especially when compared to inkjet printers. They can print up to 25-50 pages per minute (ppm) depending on the model and complexity of the document.<li>Supports multiple fonts and sizes: This is true. Laser printers support multiple fonts and sizes, which is one of their advantages over older printing technologies such as dot matrix printers.<li>The printer driver software installed on the computer sends the fonts and sizes information to the printer, and the printer uses it to produce the printed output</ul>",
